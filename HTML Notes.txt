The first line of an HTML file is its doctype.
The second line should be the <html> tag's opening tag, followed right now by its closing tag </html>.
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html></html>

In general, it's preferable to use meaningful 'semantics' when writing HTML.

The 'head' area of the HTML document includes crucial information about your web page, also known as metadata.
(Usually, most of the metadate will not change, so it is often the same for all pages in a website.)
-the page's title
-page metadata including:
-the 'character set', telling about what character encoding is used in the page
browser information, including x-ua-compatible which indicates that the IE=edge browser is supported
information about how the viewport should behave when it is loaded. Setting the viewport to have an initial 
scale of 1 controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to my Virtual Terrarium</title> each site will have a unique title
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    </head>

The main title of the page is usually within the body tag.
    <h1>My Terrarium</h1>
